## [0.0.2] - 2021-07-15
### Changed
- Using Ray call by value instead of pointer for performance increase
- Reusing Rays when scattering and casting new rays from camera for performance increase
- Return scatter result as struct for performance increase
- Hit records are now a c style out variable to save allocs

- Changed RandomInUnitSphere implementation to more efficient approach

## [0.0.1] - 2021-07-15
### Added 
- Very simple scene graph
- Minimal renderer
- Sphere and Triangle primitives
- Diffuse, reflective and refractive material
- Render multiple samples per pixel
- Basic math operations including vectors, matricies and quanternions

### Removed
- All math operations that directly add to struct, as benchmarking showed that the performance is worse than creating new values
- ApproxEqual in favor of ApproxZero, which is more efficient
